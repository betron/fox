		    <h4><a href="http://www.jonathanfoxpoetry.com/poem-about-my-teeth/" title="Permalink to Poem About My Teeth" rel="bookmark">Poem About My Teeth</a></h4>

        <p>

          <p><strong>1.</strong></p>
<p>Having endured six painful years of braces<br />
(age 11 to 16)<br />
I can’t help but get a little pissed off<br />
whenever people complain<br />
of their 2 year stint with the retainer<br />
or their 3 year dance with the dentist<br />
or their 4 year marriage to the brackets<br />
or their 5 year—their really very meager<br />
5 year ordeal with the devil<br />
a.k.a.<br />
the orthodontist.</p>
<p>I mean it really gripes my ass.</p>
<p>This is exacerbated by the fact<br />
that my own particular devil, turns out<br />
wasn’t even a real devil—<br />
just a dentist<br />
with a course in devilry<br />
a.k.a.<br />
orthodontics.</p>
<p>And whenever he used what looked like<br />
a cross between a hammer and a screwdriver<br />
to push hard against a tooth, pushing<br />
for god knows what, whenever he slipped,<br />
when the screwhammer slid<br />
over the saliva<br />
and, carried by inertia<br />
into my cheek or gum<br />
it hurt.<br />
A lot.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p>So when, years later<br />
(age 19)<br />
my parents dragged me to some oral surgeon<br />
to examine the progress of my wisdom teeth<br />
we were distressed after hearing the diagnosis.<br />
My teeth were becoming distressed<br />
by the fact that I had 4, yes 4<br />
impacted molars, should have come in<br />
after puberty, said Dr. Kleine.<br />
We were distressed by his facial expression<br />
and his serious, bushy eyebrows<br />
as he brought the grey screen of my Panorex into focus.</p>
<p>“I get about 10 cases a year this bad,” he explained,<br />
“Your lower left molar is right on the nerve<br />
that runs through your jaw. There&#8217;s a<br />
15% chance<br />
that after the surgery<br />
you could have permanent numbness<br />
in your cheek, mouth, or tongue.”</p>
<p>Stunned, I asked what would happen<br />
if we did nothing.</p>
<p>“It could cause all kinds of problems—<br />
tooth erosion, periodontal disease,<br />
to say nothing of destroying<br />
the teeth that are next to it,<br />
or causing <em>all </em>your teeth to shift back<br />
to the crookedness you had corrected<br />
with braces.”</p>
<p>Shaking now, I said I suppose<br />
we have to do it,<br />
that it was just 15%<br />
after all, right?</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it’s 100%<br />
if it happens to you,&#8221;<br />
he said<br />
half-jokingly<br />
I think.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p>We were distressed, my parents and I, back at the house<br />
but despite all the yelling, the arguing, the crying—<br />
I couldn’t help but find it a little funny<br />
how my parents were trying to blame the whole thing<br />
on Dr. Kleine, calling him “a hasty butcher.”</p>
<p>I pictured him in his backyard, in the summer,<br />
sweating, mosquitoes floating around his grey hair<br />
with a steak<br />
or a carving board<br />
frantically trying to do it<br />
as fast as possible,<br />
whatever it was that he was trying to do,<br />
so long as it was something<br />
that demanded rapidity,<br />
something serious,<br />
something very bloody.</p>
